# "Track" MERN Full-Stack Application

 
  ## Description

 
     This is a collaborative final project for UT Coding Boot Camp utilizing MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS to build an application that allows users to track their fitness goals. We learned a lot about the interaction between React components and state management and how using actions and reducers simplifies our code.

  ## Installation <a name="installation"></a> 

 <p> The link to the deployed application will take you directly to the site! </p>


  ## Track: User Experience <a name="usage"></a>

 <p>
 
 When a user visits the site they are prompted to *Login* or *Create an Account*.

Once a user has logged in, they are prompted to *Create* a new goal or *View* an existing goal. Users select one of three choices of activities in which they can create their goal. Activity choices are Running, Biking, and Swimming.

A user's goal consists of a distance in miles and a timeframe in days. Once the user has created a goal they may enter how much distance they covered for each day in their time frame.

The user's goal will display a progress bar that dynamically changes to reflect how much of their goal they have completed.

The user may close a goal at any time, at which point the goal will be closed to edits and saved in the *Previous Goals* list which can be viewed by scrolling down on the page.</p>
