# User Experience:
When a user visits the site they are prompted to *Login* or *Create an Account*.

Once a user has logged in, they are prompted to *Create* a new goal or *View* an existing goal.

A user's goal consists of a distance in miles, and a timeframe in days. Once the user has created a goal they may enter how much distance they covered for each day in their time frame.

The user's goal will display a progress bar that dynamically changes to reflect how much of their goal they have completed.

The user may close a goal at any time, at which point the goal will be closed to edits and saved in the *Previous Goals* list which can be viewed by scrolling down on the page.
